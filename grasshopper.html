    <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Using Grasshopper</h1>
	 
	<p>This section will provide a brief summary of the user interfaces for both the Grasshopper plugin, as well as its host Program, Rhino. As of Rhino 6, Grasshopper is included with the software by default. For Rhino versions 4 and 5, a download link can be found <a href="https://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/download-1">here.</a> In order to use these versions, you must provide your email. Plugins available for Grasshopper itself, as well as other Rhino plugins can be found <a href="https://www.food4rhino.com/browse?lang=en&sort_by=ds_changed&f[0]=im_field_unified_type%3A773&f[1]=im_field_platform_app%3A720">here.</a>  </p>
	 
	<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Rhino Interface</h3>
	  
	<p>Although intimidating at first glance, the Rhino interface can easily be broken down into 4 main section. These sections,as seen in the figure bellow, are the toolbar (1), sidebar (2), the viewports(3), and panels (4). Since it is not the main focus of this tutorial, this interface will only be explained up to the point needed to use Grasshopper. For more information on rhino itself, the official tutorial seres can be found <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/tutorials">here.</a>  </p>
	  
	   <img src="content/tutorial/overview.png" alt="Overview with lables" width=60% height=60%> 
	  
	<p>The toolbar is where projects can be saved and loaded, and settings can be changed, as in most programs. However, the Rhino toolbar includes a command line interface, where the user can type in any of the different function Rhino includes. This interface also features and In addition to this, the toolbar offers several different kinds of layouts, that can be selected and customized based on what takes the user is currently preforming. For now, the default setting is all that is needed. Changing the kind of layout also changes what is available in the sidebar. The sidebar offers quick access to a suite of tools most relevant to the toolset the user has selected. </p>
	
	<p>The viewport is the main way to interact with the 3D models generated by Grasshopper directly in Rhino. To focus in on an individual view, double click the tab in the top right corner. Double clicking this again will return the viewport to its split view. Left click is used to select objects in the view. By clicking and dragging, it is possible to select multiple objects by drawing a box around them. If the box is drawn from left to right, it will select everything the box is touching. If done from right to left, it will only select what is inside the box. Middle click opens up a quick select menu. In the perspective view, right click rotates the view, scroll wheel zooms in and out, and holding the shift key pans the view. In the other three views, it is imposable to rotate the views, so right click pans the view on its own.</p>
	
	<p>The panels on the right of the interface can be customized to displayed several different useful pieces of information, and can be customized by the user by right clicking the top of that window. By default, it displays information on display settings and layers, as well as a link to the official help page. Any panel can be moved around the interface by clicking and dragging its nametag, and placing it along the edge of another interface element. </p>	
	

	 <h3 class="w3-text-teal">Grasshopper Fundamentals</h3>

	 <p>An component in Grasshopper is made up of three parts; the input, the operation, and the output. Each operation is a mathematical function that manipulates  some form of data. Data is passed between objects through the use of <i>wires</i>, in a similar manner to other visual scripting languages, and flows from left to right. The data used is usually some kind of 3D object, such as a point, a line, or a surface, or an operation being applied to a 3D object. Lists of data can also be processed by a single object. When an object is producing multiple pieces of data, the connection between objects becomes a dashed line instead of a solid one. A list can be flattened into a single piece of data by using the <i>flatten tree</i> object type, or by right clicking on the object outlet that is producing the list of data.</p>
	
	<img src="content/tutorial/object_Example.png" alt="object examples" width=60% height=60%>
	
	<p>An issue or error when processing an algorithm is displayed by a color change in the problematic object. An orange object is one that has run, but has encountered an error while doing so. A red object is one that was unable to run do to its error. When an object faces an error, it creates a small text bubble that can be red by mousing over its icon in the top left corner of the object. Keep in mind that it is possible for an object to face multiple errors at once. If a wire is not passing any data between objects due to an error, it will appear as orange instead of gray.  </p> 
	  
	<img src="content/tutorial/error_Example.png" alt="error examples" width=60% height=60%>
	
	<p>In order to use objects created in Rhino in Grasshopper, right click the input of the component you wish to use the Rhino object with. From there, use the <i>set one object</i> option. The name of this option will change depending on the kind of data that component accepts. From there, the user will be promoted to select the object the wish to assign to that input from the Rhino viewport. In order to permanently create a 3D model in the Rhino workspace, right click the Grasshopper component creating that object and select the <i>bake</i> option</p> 
	 
	<h3 class="w3-text-teal">The Grasshopper Interface</h3>
	<p>Despite offering a completely different toolset, the Grasshopper interface is very similar to that of its parent software. At the top of the screen, there is toolbar that, in addition to the standard functionality of saving, loading, settings, etc. can be used to select the different tools available in Grasshopper. These tools are divided into sections based on function. Each section is further divided into subsections, which can be expanded into a dropdown menu of their own  by clicking the section label.  The main viewport (2) By pressing either middle mouse or the spacebar, the user can bring up a radial menu similar to the one found in Maya (3). </p>
	
	<p></p>
	
	<p>Components can be created in the workspace by either clicking and dragging them from the toolbar, by clicking the item in the toolbar and clicking the point where the component should be created, or by double clicking an empty part of the workspace and searching for the desired component in the text box that appears.  </p>
	   
	<img src="content/tutorial/grasshopperview.png" alt="Overview with labels" width=60% height=60%>
	
	<p>Objects successfully generated with Grasshopper will appear in the Rhino viewport. By default, they will appear red and translucent, but will turn green when the component that is generating them is selected in grasshopper. In the bottom right of the toolbar, there are several options to change which objects are drawn in Rhino, as well as how they appear.  </p>

	<p>Some components in Grasshopper have interactive GUI elements that can be used to affect the algorithm in real time. The most common of these components are the <i>slider</i>, and the <i> MD slider</i>. These two components rpovide a way to edit variables in a quick and user friednly way, and can be customized by  </p>
